# Training Flow Definitions

This directory contains JSON definitions for the Guided Walkthrough Training System.

## How Files Are Created

Flow files are **generated by the `flow-documenter` agent** after implementing user-facing features. They should NOT be created manually.

## File Naming Convention

```
[feature-name].flow.json
```

Examples:
- `behavior-logging.flow.json`
- `behavior-verification.flow.json`
- `scoreboard-overview.flow.json`

## File Structure

Each flow file follows this schema:

```json
{
  "id": "feature-name",
  "title": "Human-Readable Title",
  "description": "What the user will learn",
  "estimatedMinutes": 5,
  "roles": ["staff", "manager"],
  "prerequisites": ["other-flow-id"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-1",
      "type": "observe | action | transition",
      "role": "staff | manager | admin",
      "route": "/path/to/page",
      "mockDataState": "scenario-name",
      "narration": {
        "text": "What to tell the user"
      },
      "highlight": {
        "selector": "[data-testid='element-id']",
        "position": "top | bottom | left | right"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

```
Feature Implemented → flow-documenter agent → *.flow.json → Training Player UI
```
